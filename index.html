                <h2 class="sub-heading">Background and Education</h2>

                <p class="tribute-paragraph" id="first">Ada Lovelace is widely considered to be the first computer programmer,
                    and many could say that her programming journey began under the direction of her mother, Annabella Milbanke.
                    According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://findingada.com/about/who-was-ada/">findingada.com</a>, 
                    Lovelace's mother &ldquo;raised her under a strict regimen of science, logic, and mathematics&rdquo; with the hope that
                    Lovelace would not develop a volatile temperament like her father. Lovelace was also mentored by a scientist named 
                    Mary Sommerville, who introduced her to a mathematics professor named Charles Babbage.
                </p>
                
                <p class="tribute-paragraph">Lovelace and Babbage became great friends, and Babbage spoke very highly of her.
                    As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://findingada.com/about/who-was-ada/">findingada.com</a> reveals,
                    &ldquo;Babbage described her as &lsquo;that Enchantress who has thrown her magical spell around the 
                    most abstract of Sciences and has grasped it with a force which few masculine intellects 
                    could have exerted over it,&rsquo; or an another occasion, as &lsquo;The Enchantress of Numbers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
                </p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Contributions</h2>
                
                <p class="tribute-paragraph">Babbage invented the difference engine, then sought to develop an even
                    more powerful device, the Analytical Engine, that could handle more complex mathematical calculations.
                    Lovelace was intrigued by these ideas, and as 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.biography.com/scholar/ada-lovelace">biography.com</a> states,
                    &ldquo;Lovelace was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's analytical engine 
                    that had been written by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. 
                    She not only translated the original French text into English but also added her own thoughts 
                    and ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times longer than the original article. 
                    Her work was published in 1843, in an English science journal.&rdquo;
                </p>
                
                <p class="tribute-paragraph">Lovelace's thoughts on the Analytical Engine are described as
                    both visionary and forward-thinking. She recognized that the device had the potential to not
                    only interpret numbers, but also letters and symbols. Lovelace also hypothesized that the
                    device could be capable of executing instructional steps more than once. Developers today
                    will recognize this process as looping: a fundamental building block of writing code.
                </p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Celebrating Ada Lovelace</h2>

                <p class="tribute-paragraph">Lovelace's thirst for knowledge is evident in her own words, as
                    reported by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/celebrating-ada-lovelace-day/">Ada Lovelace Institute</a>: 
                    &ldquo;I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand it well 
                    as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of all I want to 
                    understand about the many connections and relations which occur to meâ€¦&rdquo;
                    Making connections across multiple disciplines, she also 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eWBpjlLMdQ4C&pg=PT206#v=onepage&q&f=false">stated</a>: &ldquo;The intellectual, the moral, the religious 
                    seem to me all naturally bound up and interlinked together in one great and harmonious whole.&rdquo;
                </p>
                
                <p class="tribute-paragraph">Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated on the second Tuesday in October.
                    This year, Ada Lovelace Day will be on <time datetime="2021-10-12">Tuesday, October 12, 2021. </time> This day
                    recognizes the achievements of Ada Lovelace in the computer science field, and also celebrates
                    the achievements women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
